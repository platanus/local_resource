Rails engine to treat external resources as if they were local.

## Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "local_resource"
```

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage

### Using `Instance`

```ruby
instance = LocalResource::Instance.new("http://lorempixel.com/400/200", "my-photo.jpeg")
instance.file # it downloads the photo from lorempixel.com to the tmp file.
instance.file_path # it shows the local path of your downloaded image.
instance.destroy # it removes the photo from the /tmp directory.
```

### Using `as_local_resource`

```ruby
LocalResource.as_local_resource("http://lorempixel.com/400/200", "my-photo.jpeg") do |tmp_file_path|
  # some code needing the local file.
end
```

The previous code...

- It downloads the photo from lorempixel.com to the tmp file.
- It executes custom code that needs the local file.
- It removes the tmp file from tmp.

## Testing

To run the specs you need to execute, **in the root path of the gem**, the following command:

```bash
bundle exec guard
```

You need to put **all your tests** in the `/local_resource/spec/dummy/spec/` directory.
